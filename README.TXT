// About MPD and RelaXXP   //
//=========================//

Music Player Daemon is a soundserver (MP3,OGG WAV) for Linux. MPD is
fast and easy to configure. The daemon is controlled by a set of commands 
over TCPIP. So MPD can even stream sound over the Internet.
Meanwhile there are dozens of Clients for MPD. Some are plugins, some
are graphical clients, some are web-based. Because I found, that non of
the web-based clients are useful, I decided to make my own player.
The first result is RelaXXPlayer.
RelaXXPlayer has the following specifications:
* Massive use of asynchronous http-calls (AJAX) and javascript
* Easy and fast interface with maximum oversight
* Custom skins and multiple languages
* Accessible from all computers in the network

RelaXXPlayer is compatible with
   Firefox > 1.5 * IE > 6 * Opera > 9 * Safari > 3.04

!!! Opera users must press ALT-RMB to view the context menues

// Usage of the Web Client //
//=========================//

1: Install RelaXXP (see INSTALL.TXT)
2: Open player in browser (http://<your-server>/relaxx)
3: Use mouse or keyboard to control the player.

<"Mouse">
The interface is as structured and simple as possible.
You see a layout with 3 regions. The 3 main regions (parts) are resizable.
1: The current PLAYLIST.
2: The DIRECTORY with foldertree-, search-, and playlist-tab.
3: The TRACKLIST listing folder- and playlist-content or searchresult.
If the mousepointer is over PLAYLIST or TRACKLIST-table you can open a 
context-sensitive MENU with the right mousebutton.
* A doubleclick on a track in the TRACKLIST-table adds the entry to the playlist.
* A doubleclick on a track in the PLAYLIST-table plays that song.
* Shift and mouseclick selects a range between two rows.

<"Keyboard">
Most of the commands are accessible by keyboard for your comfort.
 [1] = play previous track
 [2] = toggle (Pause/PLAY)
 [3] = play next track
 [q] = decrease volume by 5

Some of the key-commands are also context-sensitive and only available,
if the mousepointer highlights a track over the PLAYLIST or TRACKLIST-table.

/* realXXPlayer uses external tools and libraries */
RelaXX uses one of the most powerful and sophisticated Javascript-library called "MOOTOOLS",
to handle effects and the access to objects, classes and http-requests. At the server-side, 
it uses the library MPD::PHP to communicate with MPD.
